## Overview
CS2 Internal Cheat Base is a Rust-based internal cheat framework for Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). Designed with modularity and performance in mind, this project provides a solid foundation for developing various cheat features. The framework supports dynamic interface access and module management, making it an ideal starting point for internal cheat development.

## Features
- **Rust Implementation:** Utilizes Rust for its performance and safety features, ensuring a reliable codebase.
- **Modular Design:** Organizes game interfaces and components into separate modules for easy management and extension.
- **Interface Handling:** Automates the creation and access of game interfaces with macros, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Pattern Searching:** Implements dynamic pattern searching for locating functions and data structures in memory.
- **DirectX11 Integration**: Built-in support for rendering overlays using DirectX11.
- **MinHook Integration**: Uses the MinHook library for function hooking.

## Getting Started
- **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/W1lliam1337/cstrike2-hack.git
